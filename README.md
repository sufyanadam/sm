# sm

A very simple, small command line utility to post a slack message to any slack channel or
user.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sm

## Usage

Set the following environment variables:
`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`    (required) - Get this by [creating an incoming webhook integration in your slack account](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
`SLACKBOT_USERNAME`    (optional) - The user name to send the message as. Defaults to 'slackbot'
`SLACK_MSG_ICON_EMOJ'` (optional) - The avatar emoji to use for the message. Defaults to ':ghost:'

```bash
post-slack-msg 'CHANNEL' 'YOUR MESSAGE'

Example:

post-slack-msg '#doughnuts' "I've got a dozen!"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
